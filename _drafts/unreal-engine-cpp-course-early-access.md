The [Professional Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine](/courses/unrealengine-cpp) has received the first 12+ hours of major overhaul content (total course length expected roughly 25 hours) to bring it up to Unreal Engine 5.6 and above! This refresh is a complete re-recording of the original course for Unreal Engine C++ development following roughly the same project's design. The course includes further streamlining of the curriculum and covering both big and small features of Unreal Engine 5 such as Enhanced Input, Niagara (for gameplay), InstancedStructs, Data-oriented Programming, and lots more...

## Free Upgrade

This **Unreal Engine 5 version is a FREE upgrade for all current students**. It has taken many months of work and I am doing everything I can to make it more than a simple re-recording of the exact same content. Instead every single line of code has been reviewed and considered. This resulted in streamlined lesson plan and a chance to swap out some repetitive bits of the original with more exciting concepts either new to UE5 or that simply did not make it into the original curriculum for any number of reasons.

{: notice--info }
You are automatically enrolled into the Early Access Refresh when purchasing the original course. The landing pages will be swapped out once the refresh hits the full "v2.0" launch.

## What's Changed?

Every lesson is re-recorded and revisited. The overall structure of the lessons has improved. Certain (gameplay) mechanics have been swapped out to allow more interesting programming concepts to be covered instead.

Not only does it refresh the content for Unreal Engine 5, it will include additional programming concepts such as Data Oriented Programming, which is an alternative to the usual OOP (Object Oriented Programming) using objects such as Actors and instead focusing on data first. This allows for significantly higher performance in certain scenarios and can often keep code simpler at the same time!

The general design of the game you will build during the course remains largely the same. A third-person action RPG/Roguelike with a custom GAS-like system, enemy AI and full multiplayer support.

The currently available lesson plan:

- Project Setup - configuring a character for third-person and using Enhanced Input.
- Creating a projectile based attack including Animations, Niagara, MetaSounds, delegates, damage, etc.
- Assignment 1: Jumping and building an Explosive Barrel
- Interaction System, collision queries, interfaces.
- Blueprint scripting on top of our C++ to build out mechanics
- Assignment 2: Blackhole & Teleport Projectiles
- Player Attributes - setting up Health, death, delegates and UI
- Debugging tools, including CVARs, asserts
- Applying polish into the systems
- Assignment 3: Health Pickup
- Enemy Monsters: building out AI using Behavior Trees (StateTrees used elsewhere)
- Assignment 4: Flee & Heal behaviors for enemies
- Action System: building our own [GAS](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-ability-system-for-unreal-engine)-like including Actions, Buffs/debuffs, Attribute handling.
- Using GameplayTags in-depth.
- ...remaining lessons uploaded on a weekly schedule

## UE4 Course Access

The original "Unreal Engine 4" version will remain available for new and existing students. If you are currently following that version of the course, you can continue to do so without interruption. The course refresh exists as its own course product on the platform.

## Price Adjustment

As a reminder, once the full refresh is completed, the price of the course will be adjusted. The projected price is $395,- for the Indie and $795,- bringing it in line with the [Complete Game Optimization for Unreal Engine 5](/courses/unrealengine-optimization) Course and still sits well **below** the inflation rate over the past 4 years since the original course launched.

## Early Impressions from Students

Feedback from students with early access have been overwhelmingly positive! This gave me the confidence I am on the right track for the remainder of the content. A few snippets below to give you an impression:

*"This has so far been the best course I have ever taken that is better than anything else I've seen. I have been working with UE since 4.26 and I was doubtful coming to this course that 'What if I already know this stuff' but oh my god. Since the first lecture I am learning bits and shortcuts for things I have used so much of my time on. From switching to Rider, to different implementation methods of BPs and callbacks, to debugging, with actual usage of assets rather than some UE_LOG with some numbers."* - Pouya N.

*"This is the best Unreal Engine 5 Course hands down. I now feel like I am comfortable enough to start a new project and just start working on a small concept to keep learning and running into problems. I like that you purposely leave things simple until you run into an issue where you need to change something or add to it. Running into those problems is what reinforces learning, at least for me. I love the links you post with each video they are super helpful when something works but I don't really have a good understanding of it. It really shows you how you build a system for a game from scratch. Other courses just do too much at once often leaving the student asking why something was done this way."* - Adrian L.

*"...This new course refresh looks incredible, thanks so much for all your hard work!"* - Joe P.

## What's Next?

In the next few weeks or months the remainder of the lessons will be completed. You can check back regularly as every week new lessons are published. This refresh has been a long time coming, and I am excited to finally be so close to finishing and making it available to all students! You can support me by telling your friends and colleagues about the course and the new update!
