## JetBrains Rider vs. Visual Studio

I find myself using a small set of hotkeys the most. Especially during my tutorials or courses you may benefit from having an easy reference to what an action is called in either JetBrains Rider or Visual Studio (I personally use Rider during all video content). This hotkey list compares the available tools and which hotkey is assigned by default.

## Common IDE Hotkeys

For Rider I have selected the "Visual Assist" keymap as that is what I used with Visual Studio prior to moving to using Rider. I have included Rider keymap PDFs below if you are using a different Keymap as the default in Rider.

| **Rider Name** | **Visual Studio Name** | **Rider Hotkey** | **Visual Studio Hotkey** |
