      <p>
        Game developer with <b>10+ years of Unreal Engine</b> and 17+ years of game development experience, as an indie developer, Unreal Engine consultant, and engineer at Epic Games! Over the years I <b>created countless tutorials, courses, and sample projects</b> for the Unreal Engine community from beginner to advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have taught Unreal Engine C++ to Computer Science students at <b>Stanford University</b>. My online courses have over <b>50,000+ students</b> with a rating of 4.7+. My courses are <b>used by thousands of AAA developers working at some of the biggest studios</b> around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consult for game studios on Unreal Engine and game performance. This is another great way to keep up with the game industry and can feed this knowledge back into my courses!
      </p>
      <p>
        Through my courses, I hope to teach you what I learned over the years and help you build your games the right way! I love explaining challenging concepts by going hands-on and showing by example. I am passionate about taking these seemingly difficult concepts and boiling them down into easy-to-follow guides. My goal is to make game development approachable to anyone willing to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides teaching, I make games as an indie game developer, which keeps me up-to-date on Unreal Engine, C++, and the game creation process.
