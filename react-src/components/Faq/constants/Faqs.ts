    },
    {

    {
        question: "Is this course compatible with Unreal Engine 5?",
        answer: "Yes, the course works for any version Unreal Engine 4.25+ and the latest version of 5! The Unreal C++ concepts have remained the same, there are only minor differences for us between both versions. Where necessary, lectures will include the changes."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I follow along on Mac and/or Visual Studio alternative?",
        answer: "Yes. It works on platforms other than Windows, and Visual Studio isn't required either! You can use apps like Rider, Visual Studio Code, or XCode. Some code editor features may look a little different. We write exactly the same code and use the same workflow regardless of IDE/OS you wish to use."
    },
    {
        question: "What level of programming know-how is expected before starting?",
        answer: "The course is challenging and assumes some basic programming experience. While knowing basic C++ is ideal, other programming languages like C#, Java, etc. work fine too as they all share the same core principles we need to write games with Unreal Engine."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this an official Stanford University course?",
        answer: "No, while this course curriculum has been taught to Computer Science students at Stanford University it is not affiliated nor owned/managed by the university in any capacity. Therefore, enrolling in this course does not make you a Stanford student, but the quality of the course should speak for itself!"
    },
    {
        question: "Is there Q&A support?",
        answer: "Yes, I am available to help you throughout the course!"
    },
    {
        question: "How does this compare to your previous courses?",
        answer: "It's been 4 years since the last course, and a lot has changed since then! I've learned many new things about C++ concepts, Unreal quirks, building a gameplay framework, and industry best practices that I've incorporated into this course. Even if you took my previous course, this new program contains a lot of valuable new information that is difficult to find elsewhere."

    {
        question: "Are English Captions/Subtitles available?",
        answer: "Yes! All videos have handmade English Captions."
    },
    {
        question: "I'm interested in your course, but the exchange rate is too high for me. Is there anything you can do?",
        answer: "Please don't hesitate to reach out directly via info@tomlooman.com to discuss discounts or alternative payment options. We want to make sure that our course is accessible to everyone."
    },
    {
        question: "I am transitioning from Unity, is this course a good fit for me?",
        answer: "Absolutely! Unreal's C++ isn't as scary as you might think coming from C#. I was in the same boat many years ago with a C# background myself."
