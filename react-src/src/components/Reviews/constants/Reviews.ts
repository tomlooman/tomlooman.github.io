First of all <strong>Tom has an excellent way of presenting the material, being both engaging and informative</strong> (a difficult combination to get right!).<br/><br/>Personally, I really enjoy how Tom humors the <strong>occasional short detour to explain a tangential concept or feature of the engine. It's those kinds of things that make this course so valuable</strong>, encouraging me to look into and learn every nook and cranny I run into. In my past experience, there's really no substitute for learning a system besides chasing curiosity. It's refreshing to see Tom exemplify that in his lectures. <br/><br/>I also think it is crucial to have exercises/assignments in any learning material, and <strong>Tom does an excellent job of introducing challenges that are substantial yet achievable.</strong> He clearly designs his assignments to leverage all the concepts he has taught so far, without leaving me to 'fend for myself' too much.\"",
