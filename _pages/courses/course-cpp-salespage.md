Whether you want to fast-track your onboarding into Unreal Engine C++ or get out of tutorial hell, this course will guide you through it all with industry best practices and teaches you the skills and confidence to continue programming on your own after completing this course.

In this course we build a small game and touch on hundreds of fundamental concepts (including building a good framework, debugging and optimization) both for C++ and Unreal Engine specifics that would normally require endless trial and error to figure out on your own.

Whether you have been programming for a decade or are only just getting started...as one of my students you will learn everything you need to succeed in programming with Unreal Engine. **You will be taught industry standards and best practices that you can take into your professional career as a game developer.** During the lessons every programming decision will be explained, including alternative approaches, pitfalls and common mistakes. This way you can expertly reason about your own code after this course has finished. During the lessons, We will naturally run into compiler errors and bugs and solve them together as that is what real game development is like.

The course has around 25 hours of lesson content and packs **15+ years of Unreal Engine experience** into a structured learning path. Besides the lessons there are 7 assignments to complete. Each assignment reinforces the systems used and asks the student to explore the engine on their own. This truly builds the required skills to become a competent developer with the engine. As a result my courses have been adopted by dozens of AAA game studios around the world for their onboarding and training needs.

The original course was taught to Computer Science students at **Stanford University** in 2020 ("Video Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine" - Class CS193U) and has since been remastered and improved for Unreal Engine 5.

## Why take this course?

The course solves the big problems C++ developer face when getting into Unreal Engine. A lack of clear documentation, no structured learning path to follow, and free tutorials teaching bad habits or shortcuts that do not hold up an any real production environment. You may be intimidated to explore this massive engine on your own, this course will fix that.

### Structured & reliable

Well structured and reliable information for C++ in Unreal Engine is hard to come by. More so for intermediate and above programming topics. Many of the "Unrealisms" take years to discover or fully understand, this course curriculum fast-tracks your entry into Unreal Engine by covering every programming concepts you need to know in day-to-day development. Safe yourself hundreds of hours by learning it the right way immediately.

### Learn development the Epic way

With over 15 years of experience in Unreal Engine, including some time at Epic Games, I know what it takes to build a proper game framework and keep code simple and easy to maintain. Having encountered and solved hundreds the obscure issues, bugs and mistakes - I will guide you through it all and teach you Unreal Engine 5 the Epic way.

### Gain independence, escape tutorial hell

Throughout the course lessons We encounter compile issues and bugs during the course and solve them together. You complete challenging assignments to reinforce you new skills and gain new ones by having to explore on your own. Build and use debugging tools and stay ahead of problems through asserts, verification and logging. Every step building to your independence as a programmer. You can confidently continue building games after completing this course.

## Is this course for you?

Whether you have only just started programming or well over a decade, you will learn something new during this course. It is recommended to know the basic fundamentals of programming such as functions and variables, but no prior C++ experience is necessary. Knowing the basics of any other programming language or even just Blueprints is enough to get started.

You are guaranteed to learn something new, even as a multi-year veteran of the industry of the Unreal Engine itself.

**The Ideal Student:**

- Any programming professionals seeking to re-train to Unreal Engine
- Intermediate-level Unreal Developers looking to improve their C++ skills and learn new tricks
- Programmers moving from another engine to Unreal Engine
- Students in game development (or computer science)
- Tech artists looking to get into C++ game development

## Why you will love this course

This course contains 15+ years of my Unreal Engine experience and I truly believe it is something you will love to take part in! I have managed to pack so much of what I had to learn the hard way and can now guide you through this in an easy to follow curriculum.

A lot of what you will learn here is simply not available elsewhere and certainly not in such a cohesive and structured learning experience. These are not one-off tutorials taking shortcuts while teaching you bad habits...You will build a proper game and framework with solid foundational coding skills that you can take into your career as a game developer!

My 5000+ students are from all backgrounds including AAA studios, indie developers, and those just starting out in the industry! Many AAA studios have been using this course to train new and current employees in Unreal Engine C++.

## Training For Studios

Save time and money by offering your new hires a structured and industry proven curriculum to onboard them efficiently into any team using Unreal Engine C++.

The course has been used by game studios of all sizes for many years - from small indies to the largest studios in the world. We offer flexible enrollment to fit your needs on top of discounted prices on bulk enrollment.
