## Introducing: Professional Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine 5

This Course is hands-on game development in C++ with Unreal Engine 5. A step-by-step guided (self-paced) course where you build a third-person action game and master the critical foundational understanding of the Unreal Engine C++ game development architecture and best practices.

During the course we will cover every aspect of game programming including designing a good framework, debugging, optimization. You will build the confidence to continue on your own after this course has completed. No more tutorial hell. Through building the game during the course you will be introduced to all the need-to-know programming concepts and standards you need in day-to-day game development.

Whether you have been programming for a decade or barely a year...my students discover what they need to know quickly and smoothly. You can rest assured that you will learn industry standards and best practices that you can take into your professional career as a game developer. During the lessons every programming decision will be explained, including alternative approaches, pitfalls and common mistakes. This way you can expertly reason about your own code after this course has finished. We will run into compiler errors and bugs and solve them together as that is what real game development is like.

The course packs 15+ years of Unreal Engine experience into a course, fast-tracking your own skill set to hit the ground running. My courses have been adopted by many AAA game studios around the world for their onboarding and training needs.

The original course was taught to Computer Science students at **Stanford University** (Video Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine - class CS193U).

## Training For Teams

The course is used by game studios of all sizes - from small indies to the largest studios in the world - to train employees in Unreal Engine C++ game development for many years. We offer flexible enrollment for teams to fit your needs on top of discounted prices on the Pro-tier. You can reach out directly through [info@tomlooman.com](mailto:info@tomlooman.com) for more information.

## Why take this course?

The course solves most of the big problems C++ developer face when getting into Unreal Engine. A lack of clear documentation, no learning path to follow, free tutorials teaching bad habits and shortcuts that do not hold up an any real production environment. You may be lacking confidence to explore the massive engine on your own, this course will fix that.

### Structured & reliable

Well structured and reliable information for C++ in Unreal Engine is hard to come by. More so for intermediate and above programming topics. Many of the "Unrealisms" take years to discover or fully understand, this course curriculum fast-tracks your entry into Unreal Engine by covering every programming concepts you need to know in day-to-day development. Safe yourself hundreds of hours by learning it the right way immediately.

### Learn development the Epic way

With over 15 years of experience in Unreal Engine, including some time at Epic Games, I know what it takes to build a reliable game framework and keep code simple and easy to maintain. Having encountered all the obscure issues, bugs and mistakes - I will guide you through it all and fast track your mastery of Unreal Engine 5.

### Gain independence, escape tutorial hell

We encounter compile issues and bugs during the course and solve them together. You complete challenging assignments to reinforce you new skills and gain new ones by having to explore on your own. Build and use debugging tools and stay ahead of problems through asserts, verification and logging. Every step building to your independence as a programmer. You can confidently continue building games after completing this course.

## What You'll Learn

You will learn how to properly build games including a solid framework to write code that can be applied to any genre and design. We focus on touching on as many programming concepts as possible during the course, while providing reasoning and pitfalls while doing so. This lays a strong foundation to continue independently after completing the course.

### Build Together

We build the game project together in the most natural way possible including the occasional compile errors and bugs. Throughout I explain why these happen and how to solve them. We use asserts, breakpoints, debuggers and some of the highly valuable built-in tools of the Unreal Editor to stay ahead of problems and solve them effectively when they do occur. Giving you the knowledge and tools to handle similar problems on your own in the future.

### Profiling & Performance

Besides providing you with every single tool and trick required for game development with C++ we also include some performance profiling and optimization to better understand the consequences of your coding decisions and how to measurably improve upon them. This includes profiling with Unreal Insights and writing performant code using Data-oriented programming.

### Multiplayer

Every feature and mechanic will support Epic's Network replication step-by-step to provide you a clear foundational understanding on how multiplayer games are build.

### Game AI

We use all the major AI Module systems including Behavior Trees, State Trees, Environment Query System, Perception System and more!

### And so much more...

Persisting player progress to disk, moving between levels, asynchronous loading of assets, controlling VFX, Materials and Audio from code, building the game UI, controlling player animations, building out debug tools, etc. the course is packed with everything you need to succeed as a game developer!

## Is this course for you?

Whether you have only just started programming or well over a decade, you will learn something new during this course. It is recommended to know the basic fundamentals of programming such as functions and variables, but no prior C++ experience is necessary. Knowing the basics of any other programming language or even just Blueprints is enough to get started.

You are guaranteed to learn something new, even as a multi-year veteran of the industry of the Unreal Engine itself.

### Here are some types of students that would be a great fit:

- Any programming professionals seeking to re-train to Unreal Engine
- Intermediate-level Unreal Developers looking to improve their C++ skills and learn new tricks
- Programmers moving from another engine to Unreal Engine
- Students in game development (or computer science)
- Tech artists looking to get into C++ game development

## Course Details

### Built for Unreal Engine 5

The original Stanford University course has been entirely rebuilt for Unreal Engine 5. Updated best practices and including the new features and tricks introduced with UE5.

### Course Duration

The total lessons are approximately 25 hours in length. On top of that we offer 7 assignments that challenge your new skills and challenge you to explore a bit on your own. They make take a few hours to complete.

### Certification

There is a certificate of completion provided upon finishing this course.

### Long Term Support

My courses are built for long-term, multi year support. As Unreal Engine changes, so does the course. Your questions will be answered even if you return to the course years later.

### Open Source on Github

The code is available on GitHub as an ongoing open-source developed game project. With every lessons the specific code commit is included so you can compare the changes side by side to quickly resolve any issues you may have encountered.

### Unreal Engine 4 & 5

When enrolling into the course you receive both the original course recorded in Unreal Engine 4 and the latest major upgrade fully recorded using Unreal Engine 5.6.

## Why you will love this course

This course contains 15+ years of my Unreal Engine experience and I truly believe it is something you will love to take part in! I have managed to pack so much of what I had to learn the hard way and can now guide you through this in an easy to follow curriculum.

A lot of what you will learn here is simply not available elsewhere and certainly not in such a cohesive and structured learning experience. These are not one-off tutorials taking shortcuts while teaching you bad habits...You will build a proper game and framework with solid foundational coding skills that you can take into your career as a game developer!

My 5000+ students are from all backgrounds including AAA studios, indie developers, and those just starting out in the industry! Many AAA studios have been using this course to train new and current employees in Unreal Engine C++.
