----- v1 ------

Welcome to my course on game development in C++ with Unreal Engine. In this project-based course, you will build a third-person action game and gain a comprehensive understanding of the Unreal Engine C++ game development architecture. Whether you have been programming for years or are just starting out, this course is designed to help you master Unreal Engine and advance your game development career.

With a focus on hands-on learning, this course covers the essential concepts and techniques of programming in C++ within the Unreal Engine environment. You will learn about Unreal Engine's class hierarchy and core features, as well as best practices for debugging, optimization, and gameplay systems. By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and skills to confidently create your own games using C++ and Unreal Engine.

With its powerful tools and advanced features, Unreal Engine is a popular choice for game developers. However, information about Unreal Engine C++ is often difficult to find. This course brings together the best of what I have learned from over 10 years of experience to provide you with a structured and engaging learning path. You will learn everything you need to know to start building your own games with C++ and Unreal Engine. Join me and let's master Unreal Engine together!

This course was taught to Computer Science students at Stanford University (Video Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine - CS193U).

## What You'll Learn

You will learn how to properly build your game including a solid framework to write professional-grade code that can be applied to many genres and designs. The code you write will be invaluable regardless of your own game project's design as you learn to code games containing flexible coding principles that are widely applicable. This includes a 'Gameplay Ability System' style system we create from the ground up and event-based coding principles for efficient game loops and UIs.

Throughout the course we will cover the Unreal specific C++ features and concepts including the Unreal Property System which is a powerful tool to expose your code to the editor and Blueprint. We create a game on top of Unreal's Gameplay Framework using the "Unreal-way" of making games. Along the way I explain the reasoning behind the code we write, discovered through years of learning, experimenting, and iterating.

Debugging your code is an invaluable skill, and so we will cover debugging tools and tricks for both C++ and Blueprint. We finish that up with performance profiling tools to find bottlenecks or bugs that affect your gameplay.

The game would not be complete without some AI opponents or multiplayer with friends, you will learn how to implement both! You will discover how to use the Unreal Engine AI features including Behavior Trees, Environment Query System and create custom C++ nodes to extend the AI capabilities. We then move on to make all our game logic work seamlessly in multiplayer as well.

But even that is not all. I will demonstrate how to save the game state to disk, asynchronously load game assets, how to control VFX and materials from code, build responsive User Interfaces with UMG, GameplayTags, Animation Blueprints, creating of debug commands and so much more!

Major Features
Building C++ Game Framework
Combining C++ and Blueprint for flexible game logic
Unreal's Gameplay Systems
Event-based Programming Principles
AI Programming (Behavior Trees, Blackboard, EQS, Custom C++ Nodes)
Multiplayer Networking (Replication architecture, low-bandwidth, best practices)
Saving Game State to Disk (Saving/loading player progression and world state)
Performance Profiling Tools (Unreal Insights & in-editor tools)
User Interfaces with UMG (using Event-based Principles)
Async Asset Loading & Soft References
Throughout the course you will work on 7 challenging assignments to complete on your own. These are backed up with in-lesson walkthroughs and source code repository to see how your solutions compare to mine including reasoning with code discussed during class.

Besides the countless features listed above, the course contains so much more! It's packed with so many tips and tricks I'm 100% assured you will learn so much even for more experienced programmers...

## Is this course for you?

You might be wondering if you are a good fit for this course. This course isn't for those without any programming skills whatsoever, there simply isn't time to teach general fundamentals of functions/variables and all the amazing intermediate/advanced content into a single course. You should have some basic foundational knowledge of programming, but it doesn't have to be C++. I went from C# into C++ myself pretty seamlessly, other languages like Java, Python, etc. will do just fine too!

### Here are some types of students that would be a great fit:

- Students in computer science or game development
- Studio employees just starting out with or on their way to mastering unreal engine C++
- Any Programming Professionals seeking to re-train themselves in Unreal Engine
- Intermediate Unreal Developers looking to improve their C++ skills and learn new features
- Those that are serious about a career in Game Development (Hobbyists welcome too of course!)
- Students/Programmers still wondering if Game Development is for them (This is a great look into what game programming is like)

The original version of this course was taught to Computer Science students at **Stanford University** (Video Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine - class CS193U).

## Course Details

In this course, I will be able to teach you game programming from the ground up. We will cover all the aspects required to start programming games in Unreal Engine. By skipping the basics of general programming we get to dive straight into the interesting parts of game programming and finish this course with a proper game filled with essential coding concepts and a well-designed game framework.

### Coding your game foundation

You will learn how to properly build your game including a solid framework to write professional-grade code that can be applied to many genres and designs. The code you write will be invaluable regardless of your own game project's design as you learn to code games containing flexible coding principles that are widely applicable.
