    - Some cool unreal scene I captured, maybe blending into several view modes
- Introduction Paragraph
    - What has been the reason for the course and the problem we’re solving here.
        - “There is a severe lack of knowledge available when it comes to Unreal Engine Game Performance. In this course I am to bridge that enormous gap from building your game, to running it at 60 FPS on your target devices.”
    - “We’ll dive deep into the process of profiling, finding bottlenecks and discovering opportunities to improve the performance.”
    - Unreal Engine is a complicated piece of software, throughout the course you will gain a solid understanding of how the many threads operate and how it all ties together to create a fully rendered frame.
    - There are many issues that each and every developer will run into. Sometimes (too) late in their development cycle. We’ll make sure you are informed and show you every step needed to both avoid and fix performance issues easily.
- Developed for AAA and Indie developers alike
    - The course is created for a wide audience, covering a wide range of subjects. Whether you’re an indie developer or a specialist at a AAA Studio…the course has content tailored to your needs.
    - It’s nearly impossible to find reliable best practices on optimization. Much of it is misinformed or misunderstood before being reshared again and again. In this course you’ll find best practices learned through both indie and AAA development experience including direct from Epic through sources such as UDN (Unreal Developer Network) and by talking to other experienced developers.
- Gameplay & Graphics Learning Tracks
    - Follow all content or choose a specific learning track to cherrypick what’s most relevant to your role at a studio
- **Lesson Structure**
    - The bulk of content is presented through Video Content.
    - But don’t worry, every lesson has detailed text descriptions for easy reference. This includes all the commands, class names, takeaways and other important information.
    - There is bonus content in the form of self study, where I set you up for success by providing vetted resources and information about important concepts. You can study those subjects when desired on your own.
- Embedded Example Lesson(?)
    - Could show off an example lesson like A/B Testing to highlight how it’s being taught.
    - Also need another lesson like GC that contains a lot of information in text as people may like it.

- Content at a glance / **Content Highlights**
    - Every major profiling tool explained and shown with practical examples.
    - We’ll use Lyra as a case study for optimization. You’ll see the process of profiling, analysing, applying optimizations and testing.
    - The fundamentals of profiling and performance. The Unreal Engine architecture is explained throughout the course, to better unstand how you game is updated and rendered.
    - Profiling Tools & Process
        - You may know the UI of these tools, but how do you reason about the profiling data and what steps do you take to optimize your game? ~~We’ll explore the tools and show how changes will affect your project while~~
    - Inner Workings
        - Exploring the CPU Threads, GPU Render Passes, Physics, Ticking, Animation, etc. It all works together to update and render the final frame.
        - Before you can optimize, you must understand how it works, and what your changes will affect.
    - Checkboxes, Console Variables (CVARs) and Systems
        - Exploring the hundreds of checkboxes, console variables and other settings you need to know and understand. We’ll explore them through practical examples and side effects to keep in mind (there is always a reason they are checkboxes or CVARs and not forced to a specific setting…).
    - Common Issues & Patterns
        - Many developers end up facing the same problems. We’ll make sure you’re prepared to fix or avoid them alltogether. From simple checkboxes left enabled to common misconceptions about the engine.
        - Object Pooling, Aggregate Ticks, Significance Manager are all essential systems and patterns you should be applying to your game to reach desired frame rates.
