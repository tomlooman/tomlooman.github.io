Over the years I've collected hundreds of game development resources, talks, and tutorials in my personal bookmarks. Many of these I stumbled upon and may be difficult to find on your own. This list intends to provide a large number of learning resources to everyone in a single convenient place - biased to topics I found most interesting myself at the time.
